# UART2TCP

This software creates a TCP server and forward the tcp packets to UART and viceversa. The objective is to interconnect an UART interface sending CCSDS packets to BALL Cosmos, a ground station software for telemetry and telecommands.

The code is written in python.

As an example I connected an arduino that prints the input through the UART.
